Code Path Exercise 0: Simple ToDo

This is an Android demo application for maintaining a To-Do list.

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

Required: User view a list of ToDo items
Required: User add and remove items
Required: User can edit an existing item

Spent some time making the UI work across multiple phone resolutions by playing around with the RelativeLayout.

Notes:
Coming from iOS world, creating a virtual device for testing in Android seems way complicated.
